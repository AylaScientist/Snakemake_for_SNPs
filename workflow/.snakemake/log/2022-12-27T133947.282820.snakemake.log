Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule an_table  in line 63 of /home/fish/Snakemake_for_SNPs/workflow/rules/annotation.smk:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
annotated/annotated_all_snps_KS4.ON_multianno.vcf completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 35
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
