MissingOutputException in rule mae  in line 105 of /home/fish/Snakemake_for_SNPs/workflow/rules/workflow.smk:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/SNPs_ready_mae.csv
results/SNPs_ready_no_mae.csv completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
