Removing output files of failed job results since they might be corrupted:
results/SNPs_function.csv, results/SNP_dictionary.csv, results/Treatment_SNPs_sig_all_for_Venn.csv, results/Summary_of_polymorphisms.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
